# Definitely Not Dota (Fixed)
Definitely Not Dota is a modification of Dota 2's custom Overthrow gamemode, adding hilariously overpowered heroes and encouraging constant skirmishing and ambushing. The player with the most points after 10 minutes wins!

The mod was left abandoned and stopped working after a few years, as Dota recieved updates to its engine while the mod did not. This custom game restores original functionality and playability to the Definitely Not Dota game.
